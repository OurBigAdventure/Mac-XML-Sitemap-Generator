Mac-XML-Sitemap-Generator
=========================

Simple XML Sitemap Generator for Mac OSX

Currently crawling and indexing properly, you can use this to generate sitemaps for your sites at this time.  However keep in mind that there is no visual feedback other than the beachball that the crawl is still executing. (unless you are watching the console)

TO ADD:
Core Data to record more information about the pages being crawled
Multi-Threading to allow for a more user friendly interface

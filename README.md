Mac-XML-Sitemap-Generator
=========================

Simple XML Sitemap Generator for Mac OSX

Currently crawling and indexing properly, you can use this to generate sitemaps for your sites at this time.

For a large site (5k+ pages) this crawl can take a long time and because the crawl data is stored in active memory it can potentially be an issue.

If you are going to use this often you may consider using a core data store instead of the mutable arrays that the recursive function currently uses.


POSSIBLE USES:

-Link Checker, you could add a check for broken links

-Performance Checker, you could add a check for server response times

-Broken Tag Checker, you could add a check for unclosed HTML tags

etc.

*This is a sample code project, if it was anything else it wouldn't be in a public repository.
